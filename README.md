## wincoreutils [![endorse](http://api.coderwall.com/caseydunham/endorse.png)](http://coderwall.com/caseydunham)
=====================

The goal of this project is to create a set of *nix like programs for the Windows environment. 

These are not just ports of the original C programs. 

They are written from scratch in Windows and use Windows functions where they exist.

Visual Studio C++ 2010 Express project files are also included. All of the programs were built and fully tested on Windows 7 Pro x64.

## Currently implemented
=====================


* pwd - prints the current directory. Useful if like me you don't have a prompt that displays the current directory
